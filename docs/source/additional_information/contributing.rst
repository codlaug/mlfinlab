Areas of Contribution
#####################

Currently we have a `live project board`_ that follows the principles of Agile Project Management. This board is available
to the public and lets everyone know what the Researchers are currently working on.

At the time of writing, we are focusing our attentions primarily on those contributions by the current Researchers enrolled
in our `Mentorship Program <https://hudsonthames.org/mentorship/>`_.
