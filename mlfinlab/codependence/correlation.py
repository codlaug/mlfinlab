    Returns angular distance between two vectors. Angular distance is a slight modification of Pearson correlation which
    satisfies metric conditions.

    Formula used for calculation:

    Returns absolute angular distance between two vectors. It is a modification of angular distance where the absolute

def distance_correlation(x, y):
    """
    Returns distance correlation between two vectors. Distance correlation captures both linear and non-linear
    dependencies.

    Formula used for calculation:

    Distance_Corr[X, Y] = dCov[X, Y] / (dCov[X, X] * dCov[Y, Y])^(1/2)

    dCov[X, Y] is the average Hadamard product of the doubly-centered Euclidean distance matrices of X, Y.
