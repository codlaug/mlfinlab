    """
    This class implements the Hierarchical Risk Parity algorithm mentioned in the following paper: `LÃ³pez de Prado, Marcos,
    Building Diversified Portfolios that Outperform Out-of-Sample (May 23, 2016). Journal of Portfolio Management,
    2016 <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2708678>`_; The code is reproduced with modification from his book:
    Advances in Financial Machine Learning, Chp-16
    By removing exact analytical approach to the calculation of weights and instead relying on an approximate
    machine learning based approach (hierarchical tree-clustering), Hierarchical Risk Parity produces weights which are stable to
    random shocks in the stock-market. Moreover, previous algorithms like CLA involve the inversion of covariance matrix which is
    a highly unstable operation and tends to have major impacts on the performance due to slight changes in the covariance matrix.
    By removing dependence on the inversion of covariance matrix completely, the Hierarchical Risk Parity algorithm is fast,
    robust and flexible.
